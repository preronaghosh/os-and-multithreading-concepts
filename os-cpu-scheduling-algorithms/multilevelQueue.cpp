/* Multilevel Queue Scheduling 

*** Definition:
Multi-Level Queue Scheduling is a CPU scheduling algorithm that divides the ready queue 
into multiple separate queues, each for a different type or priority of process. 
Each queue has its own scheduling algorithm, and processes are permanently assigned to a 
queue based on some property (e.g., priority, memory needs, process type like system/user).

*** History:
- To implement the round robin + priority scheduling algorithm, we use a single queue.
  Searching for next highest priority process in a queue may require O(n) time, which 
  is very high for a high value of N.

- Hence, we define a single queue for every priority level. Push the process with priority 1
  to queue 1, priority 2 to queue 2 and so on. This way, scheduler just takes the queue.front()
  from the highest priority queue. If it is empty, go to the next highest priority queue.

- In addition, there must be scheduling between the queues, which is commonly implemented as 
  Fixed Priority Preemptive Scheduling. This is called a Queue scheduling policy which decides 
  which queue to select next (e.g., fixed priority, time-slicing among queues).

*** Advantages:
- Separates different types of processes cleanly.
- Efficient handling of real-time vs background tasks.

*** Disadvantages:
- Starvation of lower-priority queues.
- Rigid â€” processes can't move between queues dynamically.
